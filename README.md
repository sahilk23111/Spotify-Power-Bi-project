For the Spotify Power BI Project, I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes top artists, genres, and listening trends. Using Spotify data, I created dynamic charts to track artist popularity, song performance, and streaming trends over time. The dashboard enables users to filter data by date, artist, and genre, offering clear insights into user preferences and emerging music trends. This streamlined reporting process and enhanced data-driven decision-making for playlist curation and marketing strategies.
